NAME
    Class::Value::SemanticAdapter - Adapter for Data::Semantic objects

VERSION
    version 1.100840

DESCRIPTION
    This class is an adapter, a wrapper, that turns Data::Semantic objects
    into Class::Value objects.

METHODS
  "semantic_class_name"
    Returns the corresponding semantic class name. This method provides a
    default mapping, the idea of which is to mirror the layout of the
    Data::Semantic class tree. If you have a different mapping, override
    this method in a subclass.

    So in the Class::Value::URI::http class, it will return
    "Data::Semantic::URI::http".

  "adaptee"
    Takes the results of "semantic_class_name()" and "semantic_args()",
    loads the semantic data class and returns a semantic data object with
    the given args passed to its constructor.

  "semantic_args"
    Return those of the value object's attributes, in hash format, that are
    relevant to the semantic data object constructor.

  "is_valid_value"
    Like the same method in Class::Value, but forwards the question to the
    adapted data semantic object.

  "normalize_value"
    Like the same method in Class::Value, but forwards the question to the
    adapted data semantic object.

  "is_valid_normalized_value"
    Like the same method in Class::Value, but forwards the question to the
    adapted data semantic object.
